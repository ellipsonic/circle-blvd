                h2 Tour: Getting started

                p.before-video.
                    Welcome to Circle Blvd, a really nice todo list, for 
                    groups. It works for individuals, too, but it was made with groups 
                    of up to 12 people in mind.

                        p.
                            Circle Blvd is all about managing your group's task list, so that's
                            where we'll start.

                        p.
                            Below is an example list with four items in it, outlining
                            a hypothetical road trip. The list is interactive, meaning it
                            will react the same way as a list in a real account.

                        owners="['Alaina', 'Nicholas', 'Phil', whoami]" 
                        keyboard="keyboard" mouse="mouse" is-facade="isFacade")

                    h3 Moving tasks
                    p.
                        Circle Blvd helps you prioritize tasks by dragging and dropping them
                        with your mouse. Move tasks up and down by dragging (clicking and holding) the 
                        <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-move"></i> icon, 
                        on the right side.

                    p All the tasks can be moved &ndash; we just use that square 
                     | placeholder to make the list easier on the eyes.


                    h3 Using the black task for focus
                    p The black tasks signifies your next deadline, or milestone. Move the black task to a different spot. Go on. We'll wait.
                    p ...
                    p Ok? How you use the black task will change over time. It's just one tool to help you get 
                     | things done.

                    p.
                        For personal projects, we like to use it for what we're
                        actively thinking about. For group projects, we like to move it
                        below the tasks we want to accomplish before the next meeting.

                    p You can rename it to suit your project.

                    h3 You're ready
                    p That's it, the basics of Circle Blvd, a website (and app) for making group todo lists.

                    p You can <a href="/signin">make a new account</a> on the sign-in page, or <a href="/#/profile">start a new circle</a> on the profile page. Use the admin page to invite people to your circles.

                    h3.first Expectations
                    p First, we feel it is important to understand the dynamics behind 
                     | small-team behavior. If your team is composed of part-time volunteers, 
                     | they probably won't use Circle Blvd often. This can be frustrating if it's not
                     | expected. 

                    p We want you to know that's ok, and we have your back. We designed Circle Blvd 
                     | to help you keep track of your entire team's tasks, not just your own. 

                    h3 Adding team members
                    p Project creators can add team members using the admin page. We'll
                     | email invitations to your team, or give you invitation links if you'd
                     | prefer to contact them another way.

                    h3 Assigning tasks
                    p Each task in Circle Blvd has an optional owner, and assignments can be made 
                     | in the standard <a href="/tour/work">detail view</a>. Assignments can
                     | also be made during task
                     | entry, using the @ symbol at the end of the line &ndash;  
                     | for example, "Pick up milk from the store @Phil" will assign this task to Phil.

                    h3 Filtering tasks
                    p Use <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-record"></i> to show only your tasks. 
                     | Clicking on a task's owner name will filter your list, showing only tasks owned
                     | by that person. By the way, you can assign tasks to anyone, including people
                     | without Circle Blvd accounts, and filter on those owners as well.

                    h3 Bulk actions
                    p Select multiple tasks at once with the mouse and use <a href="/tips">keyboard shortcuts</a>
                     | to quickly keep tasks up to date.

                .docs.col-sm-offset-2.col-sm-8
                    p Our iPhone app is mostly a read-only experience, best for
                     | quick status updates, adding small tasks on the go, and 
                     | remembering your personal assignments. 
                     | The website is where to go for heavy organization.
