                h2 Tour: Getting started

                p.before-video.
                    Welcome to Circle Blvd, a really nice todo list, for 
                    groups. It works for individuals, too, but it was made with groups 
                    of up to 12 people in mind.

                    With this site you can share task lists with your group, and it all stays 
                    in sync through the internet.

                p.
                    Circle Blvd is all about managing your group's task list, so that's
                    where we'll start.

                p.
                    Below is an example list with four items in it, outlining
                    a hypothetical road trip. The list is interactive, meaning it
                    will react the same way as a list in a real account.

        sp-story-list(data="demo" account-name="whoami" owners="['Alaina', 'Nicholas', 'Phil', whoami]" 
            keyboard="keyboard" mouse="mouse" is-facade="isFacade")

            h3 Moving tasks
            p.
                Circle Blvd helps you prioritize tasks by dragging and dropping them
                with your mouse. Move tasks up and down by dragging (clicking and holding) the 
                <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-move"></i> icon, 
                on the right side.

            p All the tasks can be moved &ndash; we just use that square 
             | placeholder to make the list easier on the eyes.


            h3 Using the black task for focus
            p The black tasks signifies your next deadline, or milestone. Move the black task to a different spot. Go on. We'll wait.
            p ...
            p Ok? How you use the black task will change over time. It's just one tool to help you get 
             | things done.

            p.
                For personal projects, we like to use it for what we're
                actively thinking about. For group projects, we like to move it
                below the tasks we want to accomplish before the next meeting.

            p You can rename it to suit your project.

            h3 You're ready
            p That's it, the basics of Circle Blvd, a website (and app) for making group todo lists.

            p You can <a href="/signin">make a new account</a> on the sign-in page, or <a href="/#/profile">start a new circle</a> on the profile page. Use the admin page to invite people to your circles. Have fun!
