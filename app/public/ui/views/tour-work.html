            <p>When working with teams, you'll quickly want to edit the details of a task, which looks a bit like this when you click on it:</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="backlog"> <!-- make the #backlog CSS happy -->
        <div ng-repeat="story in storyDetails" class="clearfix">
            <sp-story/>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="docs row">
        <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8">
            <h3>Archive completed tasks</h3>
            <p>When a task is done, and you want it off the list, using 
            the <i class="btn-icon-status inline" ng-include="'/img/glyphs/icon-circle.svg'"></i> icon (next to the task summary) will move it into the archives. Once a task is in the archives, it cannot be changed.</p>


            <h3>Comment on tasks</h3>
            <p>Commenting on a task will email all the people involved: The person 
            who created the task, the task owner, and the people who have previously
            commented on this particular task.</p>

            <p>Quick, back-and-forth converations aren't really a focus of Circle
            Blvd, since there are so many other websites or apps (or texting) for that sort of thing these days. A search for "group chat" on your favorite search engine will show a few options that might compliment
            your use of Circle Blvd.</p>

            <p>We suggest using comments to ask the task creator clarifying questions, or to post decisions that have been made about a task.</p>


            <h3>Notify task owners</h3>

            <p>You may have noticed the question mark next to the task owner's name. At Circle Blvd, just because you typed someone's name into a box, that doesn't mean a task is going to be done by that person.</p>

            <p>If you want, use the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></i> 
            icon to send a short "please look at this" email to the potential owner. 
            This icon was created, as a courtesy, for those times when someone asks you to remind him or her to do something.</p> 

            <p>We suggest using this icon while you're having a conversation with the teammate. People can decide what email address they want to use to receive these notifications.</p>


            <h3>Invite people to join</h3>
            <p>Add members to your group by using the admin page
            to send them links to join your circle.</p>
