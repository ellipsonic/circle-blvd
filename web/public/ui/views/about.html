		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>Does your team know what it's doing this week? Where is your task list? On Basecamp? In shared spreadsheets? Email? In your paper notebook?</p>

		<p>We've been there. We've tried that. That's why we made Circle Blvd.</p>

		<p>Let's be frank: Circle Blvd is just a list. It's simple. It's not that smart. It doesn't do everything. And that's why it's good for your team.</p>

		<p>We made this site to give your team just enough structure and glue, to stay on the same page between meetings, to keep you focused while you make something great.</p>

		<p>Circle Blvd was created for teams who aren't necessarily sharing a day job. It's for on-the-side event organizers, or people starting businesses, or part-time community volunteers.</p>

		<p>Circle Blvd is a path, to get your team where you want to go.</p>

		<h3>Product team</h3>

		<p>Circle Blvd is a product of <a href="http://a.secretproject.org/">Secret Project</a>, a software development company based in Corvallis, Oregon.</p>

		<p>Secret Project is led by <a href="http://pmnjk.com">Phil Manijak</a>. Phil is a community organizer, co-founding the Corvallis Swing Dance Society, and a 10-year veteran of the software industry, with previous design and programming work used by millions of people across the globe.</p>

		<h3>Business plans</h3>

		<p>Our goal is to keep Circle Blvd free indefinitely, supported by <a href="/#/donate">donations</a> and sponsors.</p>

		<p>Our intention is to create a business model similar to Wordpress, in the way that it is free to download and modify, or you can rent out space on our site.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://github.com/secret-project/circle-blvd">source code</a> for Circle Blvd available on GitHub, under a BSD license. It can be downloaded and installed on most computers running Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows.</p>

		<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

		<p>A large thank you goes to Oregon's Self Employment Assistance Program and the Corvallis Swing Dance Society.</p>

		<p>Circle Blvd's engineering work owes much to many people, including those behind Apache CouchDB, Node.js, Bootstrap, and AngularJS.</p>

		<p>This project would not be possible without the community support of family and friends.</p>

		<p>Thank you.</p>
